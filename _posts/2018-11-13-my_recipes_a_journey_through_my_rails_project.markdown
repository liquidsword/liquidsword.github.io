At first I thought my Rails project was going to be a little easier than my Sinatra project, and in some ways it was, but Rails was a different beast. Even though I find the Rails framework intuitive and encompassing the capability to do damn near anything, it was this very power that became overwhelming. I found myself spending literally months on my rails project, I thought I would be done with it back in August, and it is now mid November and I am just now finishing up. So what held me back? What were in the bumps in the road? Last, but not least, how did I tackle this project and align it with the way I learn? I love writing lists, it keeps me focused :) so I will list this story:

1. I began my Rails project with lots of enthusiasm and gumption. I knew the application I wanted to create and I had the basic idea on getting my models, views and controllers all set up. As soon as I began the setup, I began to run into bugs. Which in hindsight was expected, but it was at that pivotal moment that the "uh oh" popped into my head soon followed by a "here we go!" Dispair began to brew.

2. As a new programmer, I expected these moments, afterall I ran into similar situations working on my Sinatra project, but this time it was a little different because  I wanted to solve every bug myself! I wanted to know what I was thinking when the bug occurred and how I went about solving it. I took meticulous notes which conveyed my thought processes.  If I couldn't find the answer on my own, Google would be my next goto solution finder. If Google wasn't enough I would go to a meetup on the weekend or I would go to a Rails office hour. In some sense my detective skills were being sharpened.

3. Throughout this project I had the most trouble utilizing Omniauth and getting my login/logout code to work properly. I used Facebook as my omniauth but it gave me a very difficult time to make it function properly. I'm sure I have less hair on my head because of it. But I didn't let it get me down, I would pause working on my project for some time and continue with the curriculum. I decided to go on and begin learning Javascript so I wouldn't feel stagnant in the learning process. I was so glad I made this decision because going through the Javascript modules I felt a lot better about studying programming and even more enthusiastic about eventually getting back to my Rails project. 

4. I finally went back to my project and decided to tackle all bugs in a piece-meal format. I wanted to leave the omniauth issue last.  Eventually, when everything started to come together nicely I went back to omniauth and decided to use Github as my omniauth instead of Facebook. I watched the tutorial on Flatiron that Avi created about using Github and everything started to come together. After I watched that video 3 times of course and getting help during a one on one. But alas, Github was now my omniauth 3rd party login.  My recipe application works and I actually took the time to use jQuery and created some razzle dazzle with CSS.

In retrospect I've learn ways to cope with the feeling of being overwhelmed and this Rails project brought to fruition awesome ways to learn to cope with something new and introspectively understanding the way I learn.
