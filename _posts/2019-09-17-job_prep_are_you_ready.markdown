I'm getting there. I definitely need more exposure to technical interviewing questions and feeling comfortable answering those questions on a whiteboard.  I shudder to think of having a room full of people looking at me sweating, possibly stuttering, attempting to keep my composure and at the same time answer the question posed to me. I figure with practice and review I should be okay.

I've bought a highly recommended course on Udemy for technical interview questions. It reviews not just common questions but it actually helps you to understand the answers conceptually. Therefore, it gives a good basis on how to solve similar problems and getting a better idea of the concepts involved in solving more complex problems.

I also need to become diligent with updating my blog. I haven't written in quite a while but that is mainly due to working through the curriculum. I will spend a lot more time updating my blog to expose the various interests I have including; programming, robotics, martial arts, working out, astronomy, physics and several other topics. I know that companies, especially in the tech industry, want to know more about a candidate aside from their ability to code. What better way to give an insight into oneself than a personal blog.  

In summary, I'm not as ready as I will be when I actually start interviewing.  However, I have the tools, drive and knowledge from the curriculum at Flat Iron School to help me in my quest of a new career.  I know interviews can be tough, but I'm ready for the challenge.
