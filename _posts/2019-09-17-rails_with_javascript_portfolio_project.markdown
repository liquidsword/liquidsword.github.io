At first I thought this project would be smooth sailing, so to speak, since we were tasked to upgrade our Rails project with some nifty Javascript code but that actually wasn't the case. I ran into some troublesome difficulty with my sessions controller. I had made some changes when I first started the project and when I finished creating a Javascript recipe backend and booted up my project the login kept acting buggy. It refused to go to the index page. I was thoroughly confused. I attend a few study groups to try and get to the crux of what was happening but to no avail.

So I decided to reread all materials in the curriculum on authentication, logging in, and sessions. I then rechecked my code with how it should be written and I found out that there was some errors in my naming scheme and my culinary_artist model. After some cleaning up with my code I was able to login successfully and Javascript code I wrote was also working.
