I remember when I first started to learn how to code. It was a late Saturday night at work, at the time I was working the weekend shift from 8pm to 8am (fun stuff I know), and I happened to do a search for careers on Google to get an idea of where the job market was heading.  I found many articles regarding software programming and IT so I naturally became curious. One of the articles mentioned two websites that offered free introductory courses on coding, codeschool.com and codecademy.com. So that is where my story began.

First I went to codeschool.com and I immediately loved their interface with the beautifully made icon links to different programming languages. I started out with HTML/CSS and Javascript, after a few hours of coding I knew this what I wanted to do.  I loved the control it gave me; it was simple I wrote the code and the computer interpreted it. It was a whole new sense of freedom that I'm sure all programmers feel whether they are software engineers or IT professionals, I sincerely believe we all have gained a distinct sense of freedom and control most others won't understand.

So during that late Saturday night I knew I was going to switch careers and make something of myself and programming was that link.  I wasn't a hundred percent sure what field that was going to be, but I knew I wanted to be on that yellow brick road, so here I am.
