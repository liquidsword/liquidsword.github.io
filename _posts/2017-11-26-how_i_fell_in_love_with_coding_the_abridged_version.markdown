It was a dark and stormy night...just kidding. It was a late Saturday night at work, at the time I was working the weekend shift from 8pm to 8am (fun stuff I know), and I happened to do a search for careers on Google to get an idea of where the job market was heading. I found many articles regarding software programming and IT so I naturally became curious. One of the articles mentioned two websites that offered free introductory courses on coding, codeschool.com and codecademy.com. So that is where my story began.

First I went to codeschool.com and I immediately loved their interface with the beautifully made icon links to different programming languages. I started out with HTML/CSS and Javascript, after a few hours of coding I knew this what I wanted to do. I loved the control it gave me; it was simple I wrote the code and the computer interpreted it. It was a whole new sense of freedom that I'm sure all programmers feel whether they are software engineers or IT professionals, I sincerely believe we all have gained a distinct sense of freedom and control most others won't understand. My imagination ran wild with the possibilities of all the things I could create.

So during that late Saturday night I knew I was going to switch careers and programming was that key to a whole new universe. I wasn't a hundred percent sure what field of programming that was going to be, but I knew I wanted to be on that yellow brick road, so here I am. I immersed myself into programming, I ran through the modules on codeschool.com and went straight onto codecademy.com. The code challenges were fun and I learn a lot of things that sparked my interest even more. I decided to commit myself to becoming a software engineer and I applied to the Flatiron school. I loved supportive and knowledgable the staff were and I needed that especially since I would be working and going to school online. I haven't looked back since. I must say in retrospect, it is one of the greatest decisions I've ever made.
