I used the opportunity that this project presented to create an application on a website that will allow users to create, read, update and delete artwork content that they can upload to the site. The site allowers users to join, login and logout and view their artwork all together or one by one.  Of course the whole site isn't complete but I like the concept. One of my favorite sites is www.deviantart.com but I'd like to mix it up with a facebook like content, but much more simplier, where your friends and family can check out your work or you can check out theirs.
